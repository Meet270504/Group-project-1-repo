## Interesting Design Decisions

1. *Fixed Navbar with Hover Effects*  
   The navigation bar stays fixed at the top of the page for easy access, even when scrolling. Hover effects and animated underlines were added to make the navigation more interactive and visually appealing.

2. *Full-Screen Intro Section*  
   The landing section is a full-screen hero image of a Grand Canyon sunset. This creates an immediate impact and sets the tone for the rest of the page. The hero image is paired with a call-to-action button that invites users to explore more about the canyon.

3. *Consistent Iconography*  
   Icons from FontAwesome are used alongside headings to visually enhance the text and break the monotony of content-heavy sections. Each icon is wrapped in a circle background for a modern look.

4. *CTA Button with Glow Effect*  
   The call-to-action button on the landing page includes a glow effect that grabs attention and encourages interaction. It was designed to feel playful yet functional, inviting users to explore further.

## CSS/HTML Features Used

1. *Pseudo-Classes*
   - :hover effects are applied to navbar links, section images, and the call-to-action button to improve interactivity.
   - The :first-of-type and :last-of-type pseudo-classes are used in the intro paragraph to differentiate styling for the first and last paragraphs, ensuring visual variety.

2. *Pseudo-Elements*
   - ::after pseudo-element is applied to navbar links to create a sliding underline effect, enhancing navigation clarity.

3. *CSS Transitions*
   - Transitions are used for hovering effects, such as changing color on buttons and images, providing smooth and visually appealing animations.

4. *Responsive Design*
   - Media queries were incorporated to ensure the website is responsive across different devices. The layout adjusts for smaller screens, with text and image sizes scaled down appropriately for mobile users.

5. *Custom Fonts*
   - The website uses the Google Font *Poppins*, which offers a modern, clean typeface, enhancing readability and aesthetics.
